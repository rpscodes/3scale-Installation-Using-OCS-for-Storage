:title: Installing 3Scale on OpenShift using Nooba for PV

//Description text for Solution Pattern
Developers portals have become a very important starting point for businesses that want to share their APIs both internally and externally. Red Hat 3Scale API management platform provides a highly customizable developer portal that organizations can leverage as a part of their API program. 3Scale admins can customize the developer portal using HTML, CSS, JS, etc, and make it own aligned to their own API audiences. 3Scaleâ€™s System File storage stores these Static files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc) uploaded to the System by its CMS feature, for the purpose of creating a Developer Portal. The System component of 3Scales needs an RWX(ReadWriteMany) Persistent Volume for CMS and system app assets. An RWX Persistent Volume enables multiple nodes to simultaneously read and write to the storage volume. With an RWX access mode the system can be scaled horizontally with multiple pods uploading and reading said static files, which increases the scalability of the API manager and developer portal if needed. 

This blog post explores the installation of 3Scale on OpenShift 4.x using Nooba (part of Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage) for RWX storage.

# Installation Overview
. Request RHPDS + create project
. In web console, update machinesets to change 3rd set from 0 to 1 replica
. Install 3scale operator
. Install OpenShift Container Storage operator
. Create ClusterStorage resource using all 3 machines
. Create APIManager resource

'''

### 1. Request Openshift from RHPDS
. Order `OpenShift Workshop 4.8` on the [RHPDS catalog](https://rhpds.redhat.com/catalog/explorer).

. Confirm the warning, and leave all other default settings.
. Select `Training` as the Purpose.
. Submit - this can take about 30 minutes to finish, and you will get an email. 
. If the provision fails, simply repeat the previous steps.


### 2. Create a 3Scale project
. Once provisioned, you can use `ssh` to the bastion using the SSH password provided in the email to create a new project.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also use the OpenShift Console UI to create a project
====

. sudo as `root` user:

    # sudo -i
    
. Create `3scale-amp` project.
    
    # oc new-project 3scale-amp
+

### 3. Update machinesets
. In the web UI, navigate to `Compute` > `MachineSets`
. You should see 3 MachineSets, with one spinned down. Update the machine count of that MachineSet to 1.

### 3. Install 3Scale Operator
. From the OpenShift Admin Console, navigate to Operators > OperatorHub > Type 3Scale in the search box and click on the Red hat Integration - 3Scale Operator and Install.  Make sure you are in the 3Scale-amp project while you do this and following operations

### 4. Install the OpenShift Container Storage Operator
. From the OpenShift Admin Console, navigate to Operators > OperatorHub > Type 'OpenShift Container Storage' in the search box and click on the OpenShift Container Storage Operator and Install.

+
[NOTE]
====
OpenShift Container Storage Operator will create the 'openshift-storage' namespace/project by default. This demo uses the default namespace. Users can choose any other namespace based on their scenario. 
====

. After installing the operator, you should see this message prompting you to create a `StorageCluster`. Click on the Create Storage Cluster Button
+

. Set `Requested Capacity` to `0.5 TiB`
. Select all three nodes. All other settings can keep their defaults. Hit Create. If you see a `404` message, reload your browser.
